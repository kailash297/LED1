# Wemos-Mini-D1

I am just sharing my experience on how messages can be trasmitted using MQTT Protocol, using Raspberry Pi3 as MQTT Server.
MQTT Server: Mosquitto acts as Broker and deployed in Raspberry Pi3.
Wemos Mini D1 (MQTT Client1) publishes a message and the same is subscribed by MyMQTT (MQTT Client2), an Android app in Smart Phone. 
Happy, if this post is helping you in some way!!
