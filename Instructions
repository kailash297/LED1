Bill of Material (Items needed)
1 X Wemos Mini D1 (V3.0.0)
1 X Raspberry Pi3 (9.9 Stretch Version)
1 X Windows 10 64-bit O/S x64-based Processor (for Arduino configuration)
1 X Micro-USB to USB Cable

Step1: MQTT Server setup in RaspberryPi3 under root user.
 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get upgrade
 sudo apt-get install mosquitto -y
 sudo apt-get install mosquitto-clients y
Finally perform MQTT testing between Server and Client within RPi3 itself

Step2: Setting up Wemos in Windows 10
Connect the Micro USB end to Wemos and USB end to the Windows 10 Machine.
Ensure that Wemos's in-built Blue LED light flickers when it is powered by the USB cable.
Using Device Manager > Ports (COM & LPT), verify whether USB-SERIAL CH340 is displayed as COM5
Switch off the AntiVirus and Firewall when sketch is verified / uploaded.

Step3: Arduino Configuration
Install Arduino IDE (ver 1.8.9) from Arduino Web portal https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software.
Under File/Preferences, in Settings Tab, update 'Additional Boards Manager URL' as http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json
Under Tools/Board, using Boards Manager, install 'esp8266' to install ESP8266 Board Package.
Under Tools/Board, select the Board as 'LOLIN(WEMOS) D1 R2 & mini' under ESP8266 Boards 2.5.0 (as on 10-May-2019)
Upload Speed: 115200, CPU Freq: 80 MHz, Flash Size: 4M (1M SPIFFS), Debug Port: Serial, Debug Level: Core, Port: COM5, Programmer: Arduion as ISP
Do not panic, if Tools > Board Info displays BN: Unkown Board VID: 1A86 PID: 7523 SN: Upload any sketch to obtain it. This should still work.

Step4: Wemos Mini D1 Testing
Verify Arduino environment is error free by executing example sketch through File > Examples > 01.Basics > Blink
Upon upload, the inbuilt Blue LED will flicker every 1 second.
To stop/reset above example Arduino upload the below code:
 void setup() {}
 void loop() {}
 
Step5: MQTT Client setup in Wemos Mini D1
Under Tools/Library Manager, install 'PubSubClient' ver 2.7.0
