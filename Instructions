Bill of Material (Items needed)
Wemos Mini D1 (V3.0.0)
Raspberry Pi3 (9.9 Stretch Version)
Windows 10 (for Arduino configuration)
Micro-USB to USB Cable

Step1: MQTT Server setup in RaspberryPi3 under root user.
 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get upgrade
 sudo apt-get install mosquitto -y
 sudo apt-get install mosquitto-clients y
Finally perform MQTT testing between Server and Client within RPi3 itself

Step2: Arduino Installation
Connect the Micro USB end to Wemos and USB end to the Windows 10 Machine.
Ensure the in-built Blue LED light flickers when it is powered by the USB cable.
Using Device Manager > Ports, verify whether CH340 Driver is visible as Port 4
Switch off the Antiwirus and Firewall
Install Arduino IDE (ver 1.8.9) from Arduino Web portal https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software.

Step3: Arduino Configuration
Under File/Preferences, in Settings Tab, update 'Additional Boards Manager URL' as http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json
Under Tools/Board, using Boards Manager, install 'esp8266' to install ESP8266 Board Package.
Under Tools/Board, select the Board as 'LOLIN(WEMOS) D1 R1 & mini' under ESP8266 Modules (as on 10-May-2019) 

Step4: Wemos Mini D1 Testing
Verify Arduino environment is error free by executing example sketch 'Blink'
Upon upload, the inbuilt Blue LED will flicker every 1 second.
To stop/reset above example Arduino upload the below code:
 void setup() {}
 void loop() {}
 
Step5: MQTT Client setup in Wemos Mini D1
Under Tools/Board, using Boards Manager, install 'PubSubClient'
